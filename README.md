# On-Tap

### Created By: Alexander Bly, Zane Pence, Fabio Restrepo, and Steve Valasek

A simple app to see which local bars have your favorite beers, or what your local bars have on tap. Users submit tap selections when they visit.

Users have two main ways to interact with our beer app. They have a choice of searching for thier favarite type of beer (i.e. lager, porter, stout, or wheat ale etc.) or picking a city or town to hang out in with friends. Our app with then provide a list of breweries in that selected town. 















Users can also add a beer to any establshment by choosing our add a beer option.
